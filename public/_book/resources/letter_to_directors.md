Dear Directors,

As you know, the City Council recently adopted a Citywide Open Data Policy.  This marks an exciting time in our CIty’s history where the promise of resident and employee empowerment, efficiency, and economic development combine.

The first step of this initiative is to understand the City’s data by creating a data inventory.  Because each department knows its data best, we are requesting that each Mayoral department designate, and we are inviting non-Mayoral departments to designate, an Information Coordinator and provide the name(s) to the Chief Data Officer – Maksim Pecherskiy via e-mail by COB February 6.  The Information Coordinator from each department will work closely with the Chief Data Officer to determine the data sources and repositories that each department uses, and to help create an inventory of structured information pursuant to the Open Data Policy.

Please consider the following when designating your information coordinator:

* An Information Coordinator can represent your department’s data profile and does not have to be a technical expert.
* An Information Coordinator knows the department well, understands how your department uses its data, and knows where to find answers within your department to answer a variety of questions we may be asking throughout this effort.
* Because the first data inventory is due by July 1, 2015, an Information Coordinator is available to assist Performance & Analytics primarily during the next 6 months, and potentially beyond (since data inventorying will require an ongoing effort).  The involvement will vary widely across departments, but you can expect an average commitment of about 2-3 hours a week in the early stages.
* Larger departments may designate more than one person in the event different divisions within your department have a unique individual best suited for this task.  However, please indicate in your response which divisions or business processes your multiple Information Coordinators will be responsible for so that we ensure that we do not unreasonably disrupt your day-to-day operations.
* We will notify your Information Coordinator in advance to schedule time to work on this initiative with us.

An Information Coordinator should be able to answer questions similar to the following for the department or division he or she is responsible for (please note that we are not asking for a formal response to these questions right now; they are meant only as examples in order to assist you in identifying your designated Information Coordinator):

* What data do your monthly or quarterly reports contain?
* What departmental data is currently publicly available on sandiego.gov or elsewhere online?
* What data does your department use for internal performance and trend analysis?
* What information is published as a performance metric?
* What data is reported to federal, state or local agencies?
* What data has been requested under public records requests?
* What data do other departments ask for?
* What kinds of data are agencies similar to yours publishing?

We cannot do this without you and our team thanks you in advance for your teams’ assistance over the coming months and years.  As we implement this important initiative, we will do all we can to minimize any disruption to your day-to-day activities and to be mindful and respectful of your workload.

Please contact Maksim Pecherskiy by e-mail or phone with any questions about this request. As we encounter questions on the open data front from you and your staff, we will compile those and provide access to the common Q&A’s on the Performance and Analytics Citynet page.

Let’s do something AWESOME together!
