Identify who should lead the first attempt at brainstorming a list of datasets. In many cases, it may just be you, the Data Coordinator, but it could be another colleague you feel may have a good 30,000 foot view of the department’s data.

That person will download your department’s copy of the inventory spreadsheet (MS Excel). You should have the link to download in your email, if you cannot find it, please email maksimp@sandiego.gov

Then, brainstorming can begin in the tab labeled “Step 2 Brainstorm,” begin listing the datasets as you think of them. This is literally just a list of all the datasets one can think of. When brainstorming datasets, that person should consider:

* What data populates your monthly / quarterly reports
* What departmental data is currently publicly available?
* What data does your department use for internal performance and trend analysis
* What information is published as a KPI in the budget or performance metric elsewhere
* If you were to build a dashboard for your department, what would the metrics be and where would the data come from?
* What data is reported to federal, state or local agencies
* What data requests do you receive under the PRA act.
* What data do other departments ask for, or you share with other departments now
* What kinds of open data are similar agencies across the country publishing


Have another colleague review the brainstorm if you’d like. As they say, two heads are better than one. Of course, if you’ve got a small enough department where you are the sole steward of data, than this may not be necessary.
When your brainstorm is complete, it’s time to fill out the inventory!
