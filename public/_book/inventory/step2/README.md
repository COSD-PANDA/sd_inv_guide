# Step 2

Some of your information sources may be fairly straightforward (e.g. a single sheet in a spreadsheet). In these cases, you have already identified the dataset.
In addition, you may already have a list of datasets you are publishing or plan to publish.
But others, like relational databases, may be very complex. Identifying subsets of the database that could serve as datasets, probably requires some brainstorming. You may want to include your PIO, data stewards and lead analysts in this process.
To help brainstorm, use the questions below:
* What data populates your monthly or quarterly reports?
* What departmental data is currently publicly available on DataSF or elsewhere online?
* What data does your department use for internal performance and trend analysis?
* What information is published as a performance metric?
* What data is reported to federal, state or local agencies?
* Talk with your Public Information Officer (PIO) - what data has been requested under Sunshine?
* What data do other departments ask for?
* What kinds of open data are similar agencies across the country publishing?


Caution: Donâ€™t exclude any datasets based on privacy or confidentiality concerns! Our goal is to have a holistic picture of our data. Based on this big picture, we can then decide what we should publish. Step 3 provides a means to capture privacy and confidentiality concerns.
