##Low inventory complexity
You are a department where a single division/group/person has a good handle on all the data that flows in and out of the department. If you have questions, it’s easy enough to get them answered by walking down the hall or making a quick visit to someone’s office.

##Medium inventory complexity
You are a department where, while multiple divisions produce and use data, a known group of people or a handful of individuals has a good handle on who produces what data and for what purpose. Even if the department is large (and you don’t know all of your colleagues), you can quickly identify the right person to talk to about the department’s data. Questions can be answered easily over email, a quick phone call or a quick jog around the building.

##High Inventory Complexity
You are a department where nearly every division/group uses, maintains, or reports on data, and there is no readily defined group or set of individuals who have a good handle on all of the data in the department. Even if each division/group has an individual that understands their respective data, and there may still be blindspots to explore. Your department may be spread over different buildings or many floors of a building and getting answers to questions may take many phone loops or emails to find the “right” person.
