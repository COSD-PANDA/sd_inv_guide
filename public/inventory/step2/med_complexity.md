Identify two or more of your colleagues that can brainstorm an initial list of datasets along with you. These individuals will be first completing their own independent brainstorm within department’s inventory spreadsheet.

***Each person on your team should complete an individual brainstorm within the Step 2 Brainstorm worksheet in your data inventory Excel workbook. Each person will list all of the datasets as they think of them.*** This is literally just a list of all the datasets one can think of. Don’t worry about overlapping a colleague’s list. In the next couple of steps you’ll all get together and remove duplicates. When brainstorming datasets, that person should consider:

* What data populates your monthly / quarterly reports
* What departmental data is currently publicly available?
* What data does your department use for internal performance and trend analysis
* What information is published as a KPI in the budget or performance metric elsewhere
* If you were to build a dashboard for your department, what would the metrics be and where would the data come from?
* What data is reported to federal, state or local agencies
* What data requests do you receive under the PRA act.
* What data do other departments ask for, or you share with other departments now
* What kinds of open data are similar agencies across the country publishing

Don’t worry about duplicates quite yet. If there are exact duplicates, you’ll see highlighting to indicate that. You can remove exact duplicates, but keep everything else even if you think it may be a duplicate. You’ll review these with your team in the next step.

Send out your master spreadsheet to your team to review and set up a time to get together for 30 minutes to an hour. You shouldn’t need more than an hour.
Review your brainstorm list together. Spend a couple of minutes going through the list. Review your programs and divisions together and make sure you haven’t left anything out.

Assign the inventory. At your meeting with your team, assign each person a group of datasets that they should inventory. This could simply break out by division, program or some other organizational theme that makes sense for your department. Make sure everyone knows exactly what they’ll be doing next by going over Step 3 Dataset Inventory with them.

When your brainstorm is complete, it’s time to fill out the inventory!
