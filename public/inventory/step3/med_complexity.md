Send the master spreadsheet to each of your brainstorming team members. They should find their section

Now you and your team can start populating across the datasets one by one. If this list isn’t too big, and you have good knowledge of the datasets, it’s probably something you can start in on your own. Each field has directions included as a comment. Just mouse over each one to see what you should provide in each field.

Quick tip
There are a number of fields to cover for each dataset in the inventory and we know it could be overwhelming. It may help to start with identifying the business contact (Data Steward) and technical contact (Data Custodian) first for each dataset. That way if you’re stuck, you’ll have a handy reference on who to follow up with.

Compile the individual inventories into your master after you’ve received these back from your assigned stakeholders. 

On completion you can attach your inventory to an email and send to maksimp@sandiego.gov, subject: Dataset Inventory Complete: <Your Department Name>. 

You can also quickly do this by clicking on the link to send your inventory in the Instructions tab of your dataset inventory.
