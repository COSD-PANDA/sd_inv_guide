Now you can start populating across your datasets one by one in the tab labeled “Step 3 Dataset Inventory.” If this list isn’t too big, and you have good knowledge of the datasets, it’s probably something you can start in on your own. Each field has directions included as a comment. Just mouse over each one to see what you should provide for each field.

#####Quick tip
***There are a number of fields to cover for each dataset in the inventory and we know it could be overwhelming. It may help to start with identifying the business contact (Data Steward) and technical contact (Data Custodian) first for each dataset. That way if you’re stuck, you’ll have a handy reference on who to follow up with.***

For datasets you may not have deep enough knowledge on, follow up with the business or technical contact for the dataset to fill in any remaining fields. Our recommendation is to try to get as far as possible with the inventory yourself and then pull in your colleagues to fill in the gaps.
