Please rememeber that the inventory is designed to require minimal time from information coordinators. The deadlines are tight because the initial sweep of the inventory is designed to be a fairly quick process. As departments continue to update their inventories, they will become more accurate and robust.  If during the course of this initial effort we neglect to include data sources in the inventory, we will include them later as we identify them. Please make your best effort to be comprehensive but do not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. If you feel like any of the steps will take an inordinate amount of your time (more than 2 to 3 hours a week), please [email Maksim](mailto:maksimp@sandiego.gov) and let him know.
