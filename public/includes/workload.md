Please rememeber that the inventory is designed to require minimal time from information coordinators. The deadlines are tight because this is designed to be a fairly quick process. Please note that it will be an ongoing process and the initial goal is to complete a citywide sweep of datasets that are readily identifiable. If during the course of this initial effort we neglect to include data sources in the inventory, we will include them later as we identify them. Please make your best effort to be comprehensive but do not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. If you feel like any of the steps will take an inordinate amount of your time (more than 2 to 3 hours a week), please [email Maksim](mailto:maksimp@sandiego.gov) and let him know.
